# Google-Calendar-Bulk-Deletion
Code snippet for in-browser bulk deletion of Google Calendar events

## Why you might need this script
* You imported events (e.g from an `.ics` file) into the wrong target calendar.
* You want to clean up your calendar
* You don't want to delete the events manually

## What this script does
It bulk deletes the list of calendar entries currently displayed.

## Limitations
The script does not handle additional confirm dialogs (e.g. for recurring events)

## What you have to do
Open Google Calendar, now `Search` for your target events you want to delete. Use the rich mask that Google Calendar offers here.


As soon as you verified that only those events are displayed, which you want to delete, open the developer tools via `F12` and paste the snippet into the console. Hit `ENTER` and watch the show üçø.
